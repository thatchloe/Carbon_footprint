# Carbon_footprint_calculator
Calculate your carbon footprint, and find out how much you have to do to eliminate it!
This repo is in the alpha state. It works, but oh my, it is ugly. Waiting to be implemented on actual site :)

# What is "Carbon footprint"?
A carbon footprint is historically defined as the total emissions caused by an individual, event, organisation, or product, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent.

# Who is this for?

This calculator is for anyone using electricity, who wants to know how much carbon footprint they produce, and eliminate it (by presenting the output equivalent to trees planted). This is called offsetting the carbon footprint. Of course, electricity is just a fraction of our total carbon footprint. But if you consume a lot of it, you might want to do something. Originally the calculator was made for Cryptocurrency miners, as they are very energy intensive.

# How accurate is this?

Well... There are numbers of factors which we have to talk about. 

- The most important thing is to know where your electricity comes from. Unless you have 100% self-sufficient source of electricity, or you have exact data from your electricity provider, you don't know where exactly it is from. 
- We provide list of countries and their energy source percentages. But, some countries are very big, and the national average may not be even close to where your electricity comes from (source at the end of this document). Also, countries can buy and sell electricity from other countries. 
- We also provide median values for how much CO2 each power plant type produces. Again, they are just median (most "common") values (source at the end of this document) for each power plant type. This may differ based on exact model, age, or system used in each particular power plant. 
- Apart from that, calculations are straight forward and precise.
